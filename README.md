# Group 1006 - Adult Salary Data Analysis

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

### Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to be able to analyze which classification plays a significant role in determining a person's *yearly income* based on their background specification such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc. With such data, we could see if the action towards the salary of a person fair and reasonable due to their level of efficiency in the workplace or based around their background which could result in a clear showing of discrimination whether if its racism, sexism, or another belittling approach of a personal origin. Since the data given are just basically classification without any clear context, it is hard to establish accurate reasoning of the result, and also since the data is around 25 years old, the same reasoning could not be used in today's standing of the social and political climate. The data is possible to be illustrated in a dashboard form, focusing on informing how the differences in the background would affect the incomes of workers and the size of workers based on their classification.

### Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Adult Incomes data is provided by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker from Silicon Graphics. The data illustrates how various factors such as gender, race, age, and other backgrounds affect the *yearly income* of people of numerous backgrounds. The author's objective is to predict and determine whether a person would make a $50,000 or more *yearly income* based on the classifications of their background given from census data. The dataset is also known as the **Census Income** dataset. The dataset was published on the first of June, 1996 but was extracted by Barry Becker in 1994 in The United States of America. It identifies people with 16 different variables and later evaluates the standing of each classification. In the data given, it is stated that there are 3 controls: 
1. A single-cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state
2. Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and gender
3. Controls by race, age, and gender
